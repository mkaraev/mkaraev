## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Maruf.
I'm a software engineer passionate about programming languages, functional programming, and algorithms.
I'm currently working as a back-end engineer using Golang, PostgreSQL, Docker, and Kubernetes.
I love programming languages, especially:
* Clojure
* Python
* C - just because Python is implemented in C :)

I helped students learn Python at [Hexlet](https://ru.hexlet.io/) online programming school for many years.
